# This file details the set of commands used to run the test cases for SUMMA

# There are two classes of test cases:
#  1) Test cases based on synthetic/lab data; and
#  2) Test cases based on field data.

# The commands assume that you are in the directory {localInstallation}/bin/
# and that the control files are in {localInstallation}/settings/
